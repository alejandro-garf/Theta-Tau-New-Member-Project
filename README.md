# New Member Project: Handheld Ganing Console & Website 

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Handheld Gaming Console project! In this project you will need to design and build a portable gaming console using a Raspberry Pi 4, capable of running retro games and most importantly staying within the Pokemon theme. Additionlly you will build and deploy a website to document the process

## Objective

### Part One
- Design and build a custom enclosure for the handheld gaming console using CAD software (SolidWorks) and 3D printing.
- Integrate the Raspberry Pi 4 with a suitable display, battery, and control interface.
- Develop and configure software to run retro gaming emulators on the Raspberry Pi 4 (retroPie).
- Ensure ergonomic design for comfortable handheld use.
- Ensure it works and is playable. 

### Part Two
- Create a custom website and blog that documents the process of completing the project. 
- Must contain landing page with mission statement
- Muat contain step by step instrcutions on how the project was built (including who did what)
- Must contain all files used for the project/3D printing
- Must include code documentation of the website
- Make it somewhat aesthetic 

## Team Assignments (Sample Example of split up responsibilities amongst majors)

### Design Team

#### Civil and Mechanical Engineering Majors
- **Tasks:**
  - Design the frame and enclosure of the console.
  - Use SolidWorks for CAD modeling.
  - Create the enclosure using 3D printing and/or other materials (e.g., wood, plastic).
  - Ensure the design is ergonomic and portable.

### Hardware Team

#### Electrical Engineering Majors 
- **Tasks:**
  - Select and integrate a suitable display (e.g., 5-inch HDMI screen).
  - Design and implement the power supply system, including battery selection and charging circuit.
  - Integrate buttons and joystick controls.
  - Soldering

#### Computer Engineering Majors
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate the Raspberry Pi 4 with all hardware components.
  - Ensure proper connections and functionality of all integrated parts.
  - Soldering

### Software Team

#### Computer Science Majors
- **Tasks:**
  - Install and configure the Raspberry Pi OS.
  - Install and configure retro gaming emulators (e.g., RetroPie).
  - Develop any additional software needed for game management and control interface.
  - Develop website for blog (e.g using HTML & CSS ) ** NO TEMPLATES NO CHATGPT | MUST BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN CODE **

## Budget

The budget for this project is $100.

- **Week 7: 11/8** Project Deadline
- **Week 8: 11/15** Project Presentation
## Deliverables

- Completed handheld gaming console.
- Custome website that with project documentation, including design files, schematics, and software configuration guides. 
- Presentation demonstrating the functionality and features of the gaming console.

## Getting Started

### Materials 

- Raspberry Pi 4
- 5-inch HDMI display
- 3D printer (for printing the enclosure)
- SolidWorks or other CAD software
- RetroPie software
- Various electronic components (buttons, joystick, battery, etc.)

### Resources

- The world wide web
- Active Members for consultation
- On campus resources ( 3D Printer )

### Not Allowed

- Asking Active Members to help you physically build/code
- Asking any active member for materials/use of 3D printer without paying for said materials
- Having any LLM write/genrate/debug code for you, you must only use sparringly as a consultation resource
- ** Remember this is something that you can put down in your resume and talk about during interviews, doing the bare minimun to pass the requirements for the console/website will not impress anyone **
