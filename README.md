# Handheld Gaming Console using Raspberry Pi 4

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Handheld Gaming Console project! This project aims to design and build a portable gaming console using a Raspberry Pi 4, capable of running retro games and providing a nostalgic gaming experience.

## Objective

- Design and build a custom enclosure for the handheld gaming console using CAD software (SolidWorks) and 3D printing.
- Integrate the Raspberry Pi 4 with a suitable display, battery, and control interface.
- Develop and configure software to run retro gaming emulators on the Raspberry Pi 4.
- Ensure ergonomic design for comfortable handheld use.

## Team Assignments

### Design Team

#### Civil and Mechanical Engineers
- **Tasks:**
  - Design the frame and enclosure of the console.
  - Use SolidWorks for CAD modeling.
  - Fabricate the enclosure using 3D printing and/or other materials (e.g., wood, plastic).
  - Ensure the design is ergonomic and portable.

### Hardware Team

#### Electrical Engineers
- **Tasks:**
  - Select and integrate a suitable display (e.g., 5-inch HDMI screen).
  - Design and implement the power supply system, including battery selection and charging circuit.
  - Integrate buttons and joystick controls.

#### Computer Engineers
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate the Raspberry Pi 4 with all hardware components.
  - Ensure proper connections and functionality of all integrated parts.

### Software Team

#### Computer Scientists and Software Engineers
- **Tasks:**
  - Install and configure the Raspberry Pi OS.
  - Install and configure retro gaming emulators (e.g., RetroPie).
  - Develop any additional software needed for game management and control interface.

## Budget

The budget for this project is $100.

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Project planning, team assignments, and initial design phase.
- **Week 3-4:** CAD modeling and 3D printing of the enclosure.
- **Week 5-6:** Hardware integration and initial testing.
- **Week 7-8:** Software installation, configuration, and final testing.
- **Week 9:** Project review, final adjustments, and presentation.

## Deliverables
