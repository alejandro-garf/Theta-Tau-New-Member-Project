# New Member Project: Handheld Ganing Console & Website 

# Track A

## Project Overview 

Welcome to the Handheld Gaming Console project! In this project you will need to design and build a portable gaming console using a Raspberry Pi, capable of running retro games and most importantly staying within the Pokemon theme. Additionlly you will build and deploy a website to document the process. 

## Objective

### Part One
- Design and build a custom enclosure for the handheld gaming console using CAD software (SolidWorks) and 3D printing.
- Integrate the Raspberry with a suitable display, battery, and control interface.
- Develop and configure software to run retro gaming emulators on the Raspberry Pi (retroPie).
- Ensure ergonomic design for comfortable handheld use.
- Ensure it works and is playable. 

### Part Two
- Create a custom website and blog that documents the process of completing the project. 
- Must contain landing page with mission statement
- Muat contain step by step instrcutions on how the project was built (including who did what)
- Must contain all files used for the project/3D printing
- Must include code documentation of the website
- Make it somewhat aesthetic

## Getting Started

### Budget

The budget for this project is $110.

### Materials 

- Raspberry Pi  |  $50
- HDMI display  |  $30
- Materials for Frame | $15
- Wires and other materials | $15

### Resources

- The world wide web
- Active Members for consultation
- On campus resources ( 3D Printer )

### Not Allowed

- Asking Active Members to help you physically build/code
- Asking any active member for materials/use of 3D printer without paying for said materials
- Having any LLM write/genrate/debug code for you, you must only use sparringly as a consultation resource
- ** Remember this is something that you can put down in your resume and talk about during interviews, doing the bare minimun to pass the requirements for the console/website will not impress anyone **


# Track B

## Project Overview 

Welcome to the Handheld Gaming Console project! In this project you will need to design and build a portable gaming console using an Arduino/Raspberry Pi, staying with the Pokemon theme. You will have to both design and build the handheld console in addition to programming and interactive video game to be played on the console. Most importantly, staying within the Pokemon theme. 

## Objective

- Design and build a custom enclosure for the handheld gaming console using CAD software (SolidWorks) and 3D printing.
- Integrate the Raspberry Pi/Arduino with a suitable display, battery, and control interface.
- Develop and configure software to run a video game of your design. 
- Ensure ergonomic design for comfortable handheld use.
- Ensure video game is interactive, pokemon themed, and playable with controllers.
